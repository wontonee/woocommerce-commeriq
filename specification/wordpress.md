sajudeveloper18 - let’s improve your plugin!

Thank you for submitting your plugin, "CommerIQ — AI Powered Commerce Insights for WooCommerce".

Before your plugin reaches a human reviewer, our automated tools — which help the team handle around 1,000 plugin reviews per week — have flagged a few potential issues that you may need to address. To avoid delays and help streamline the manual review process, we’ve pended your submission to give you a chance to review and fix these common issues.

🤖 This is an automated message generated using a combination of algorithms and AI. It hasn’t necessarily been reviewed by a human. Its purpose is to help you resolve potential common issues early, before manual review begins. All AI outputs are marked with the emoji ✨ and it's quite accurate.

Who are we?

We are a group of volunteers who help you identify common issues so that you can make your plugin more secure, compatible, reliable and compliant with the guidelines.

For consistency and better communication, your plugin review will be assigned to a single volunteer who will assist you throughout the entire review. However, response times may vary depending on how much time the volunteer is able to contribute to the team and if whether they need to consult something with the rest of the team.

The review process

A email envelope.

Please read this email in full and check each issue, as well as the links to the documentation and the provided examples. Also, search for any other similar occurrences of the same issue that are not explicitly mentioned in the email.
Make sure you understand the issues so that you can incorporate them into your existing skillset.
A plugin author fixing the issues.

If you decide to continue with the review process, you must fix any issues, test your plugin, upload a corrected version and then reply to this email.
In case of any doubt, please fix everything else and ask your questions alongside the update.
A volunteer reviewing the plugin.

Your plugin is manually checked by a volunteer who sends you the remaining identified issues in the plugin.
We will be devoting our time to reviewing your plugin, we ask that you honor this by following the instructions.
Note: Volunteers are not your QA team. They are here to help you identify and understand issues so that you can improve and maintain your plugin in the future. Fixing the issues is your responsibility.
A new review of the plugin.

If there are no further issues, the plugin will be approved 🎉
A warning.

Be brief and direct in your reply (please, avoid copy-pasting bloated AI responses, our AI is quite brief), be patient and make sure you have addressed all the issues and tested your plugin before responding.
It is disheartening to receive an updated plugin only to find that only a few issues have been resolved, or that it causes a fatal error upon activation.

When not making adequate progress in your review, it will be delayed and eventually rejected, for the sake of volunteers devoting their time and other plugin authors who correctly follow the review process.

Each volunteer can review up to 300 plugins per week, and they love to have life besides reviewing plugins, so please make things easier for us.


Understanding the Review Queue

When you reply, your plugin enters the review queue again. Fewer review cycles mean quicker approval, while multiple reviews can extend the process to weeks or months.
Tip: Carefully fix all issues and test your plugin before resubmitting to speed up approval.

This process is designed to help you improve your plugin while making the review experience faster and more efficient for everyone.


Have you read the guidelines and this plugin complies with them?

Upon submitting your plugin, you agreed and confirmed that it complies with the WordPress.org Plugin Directory Guidelines, which apply to all plugins in the directory.

Our automated tools have detected patterns that may require a closer look regarding compliance with certain guidelines. We will verify this during our manual review, but it’s best to address any potential issues beforehand. In particular, please pay attention to the following:
Any included code must be GPL-compatible. This means, among others, that the users have to receive the four essential freedoms: (0) to run the program, (1) to study and change the program in source code form, (2) to redistribute exact copies, and (3) to distribute modified versions. (Guidelines 1 & 4)
Plugins must not restrict or lock functionality. (Guidelines 1, 5, & 9 — see clarification on SaaS in Guideline 6)

Please check it, and if you think everything is fine, do not worry. Our tools are very thorough and may highlight different things as potential issues.

Is the name of this plugin descriptive and distinctive, and does it respect the trademarks and project names of others?

Choosing a name for a plugin can be challenging - it needs to be distinctive and meaningful, but also carefully chosen to avoid overlapping with existing plugins or inadvertently use someone else's trademark or project name in a way that could lead to confusion.

📜 General plugin name/slug requirements
Plugin names and slugs must not be too generic; they should briefly describe what the plugin does.
Plugin names and slugs can be original and unique, even if they don’t describe the functionality directly — as long as they are recognizable and distinctive.
Plugin names and slugs must be distinguishable from those of other plugins to avoid confusion.
Plugin names and slugs must respect others' trademarks and project names. If your plugin includes a trademark or project name that you do not own, you must clearly mention it in a way that denotes that there is no affiliation.

This plugin display name(s) is/are "CommerIQ — AI Powered Commerce Insights for WooCommerce" and the slug is "commeriq-ai-powered-commerce-insights-for-woocommerce" . The AI has detected ✨ "CommerIQ, WooCommerce" as potential trademark(s).

We asked a trained AI about common issues with plugin names and it thinks there might be a problem.
 ✨ The name uses a distinctive coined term "CommerIQ" and correctly places the trademark "WooCommerce" after "for" (which denotes no affiliation). However, the product name is very similar to the existing project/trademark "CommerceIQ", which can cause user confusion. In addition, the provided slug exceeds the 50-character limit.
For example, for your plugin:
An alternative name may be: ✨ Wontonee CommerIQ — AI Commerce Insights for WooCommerce
An alternative slug may be: ✨ wontonee-commeriq

ℹ️ These suggestions were made by the AI. Bear in mind that a skilled human, either you or a volunteer from the Plugin Review Team, may spot issues with the new suggested name.

⚠️ As with the rest of the review, you should address this issue and make any necessary changes. Simply changing the name without first checking what the issue is and how you can solve it won't help most of the time. Failure to address any of the issues raised will result in your submission being rejected for failing to demonstrate the expected level of effort in resolving the issues identified during the review process.

☑️ Steps to resolve this issue

Choose a display name and slug that is distinctive, describes your plugin or uses a unique name, while respecting others’ trademarks and project names, (check for further details below) then:
Update the display name in both the readme file and plugin headers.
Update the slug in your plugin files, for example in the internationalization functions.
Reply to this email requesting a new slug reservation.
In addition to the changes you have made to your code, we also need to reserve and allocate the new slug that you have chosen for your submission.
Upload a new version via the "Add your plugin" page.
If you are confident that the new name is suitable, there is no need to wait for confirmation of the new slug reservation. You may see a warning regarding the 'Text Domain', as we haven't changed the slug on our side yet. That's fine.

Also, please, don't check just this names, there are other places or resources where you may not use any trademarked (or commonly recognized) terms in a manner that that is likely to cause confusion. This includes (but is not limited to):
Your username sajudeveloper18 and your display name.
The plugin contributor's username and display name.
sajudeveloper18 - Saju Gopal
The URLs of this plugin.
Graphic resources such as this plugin icons and banners.

Are you the owner? If there are any issues with the trademark or project name and this is indeed an official plugin, it is likely that we have not been able to identify the current owner of the plugin as the trademark / project owner.
Keep in mind, if you were hired as a freelance developer or a consultant specifically to create this plugin, then they must own the plugin. This is for their legal protection as well as yours. They can add you as a committer to the plugin so you can manage it from your account, but the owner must be them, not a temp-employee.

In order to solve this, you can do one of the following:
Prove that you legally have the right to the original name/slug.
Change your user email to an official one or provide us with the user account for an official owner to whom we should transfer the plugin (they can create a new account if they need to)

Note: Should you have this plugin approved with the correct name and then go back to infringement of trademarks, we will close your plugin. Please don’t do this, even if you see other people ‘getting away with it.’ We have a lot of plugins and we’re contacting everyone in small batches to be manageable. They won’t get away with it forever, and they risk being banned from the directory. Which no one wants.

ℹ️ Tips on choosing a suitable name (and avoiding back-and-forth in this process).

Choosing a name for a plugin can be challenging - it needs to be distinctive and meaningful, but also carefully chosen to avoid overlapping with existing plugins or inadvertently use someone else's trademark or project name in a way that could lead to confusion.

🔍️ Avoid Name Similarity

Similarity is not only determined by letter-by-letter or word-by-word comparison; similar naming patterns or meanings also come into play.
In short, anything that could lead to confusion.

You can verify the uniqueness of your plugin name the same way the review team does:
Perform a search engine query for the plugin name (Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, ChatGPT) and parts of it.
If you find other plugins with similar names, change your plugin’s name to something more distinctive—perhaps by adding a coined term, your personal brand, or a unique identifier.
Go back to step 1 and check again, just in case.


Adding a generic word to the name to avoid similarity won't help.

⚖️ Avoid Trademark / Project Names Confusion

Identify trademarks and project names mentioned in your plugin name "CommerIQ — AI Powered Commerce Insights for WooCommerce"and the slug "commeriq-ai-powered-commerce-insights-for-woocommerce" . The AI has detected ✨ "CommerIQ, WooCommerce" as potential trademark(s).

To avoid potential misuse:
If a trademark or project name is used at the beginning of your plugin name/slug and you are not the owner, it could imply false affiliation.
If the trademark appears elsewhere in the name/slug but is not part of a clear structure indicating unaffiliation, it may still be problematic.
Do not use any altered forms of a trademark, such as blend words or portmanteaus.

A safer naming pattern is to place the trademark at the end, following a phrase like "for" or "with".

👀 Examples

Assuming you are creating a plugin that integrates with WooCommerce and you are not WooCommerce:
❌ "WooCommerce Prices Updater" Trademarks issue as it implies affiliation with WooCommerce.
❌ "Prices Updater WooCommerce" Trademarks issue as it lacks a clear structure indicating no affiliation.
❌ "Prices for WooCommerce" It is too generic.
❌ "PricesPress for WooCommerce" This is considered portmanteau using the WordPress trademark.
❌ "Prices Updater for WooCommerce" Regarding trademarks it avoids indicating affiliation. However, there is a similarity issue, as there are other plugins with similar names.
❌ "Simple Prices Updater for WooCommerce" Similarity issue: Adding a generic word to avoid similarity won't make it sufficiently distinguishable.
✅ "Priconix Sync for WooCommerce" Ok! Original, distinguishable, unique name that is also not in use by others.
✅ "sajudeveloper18 Prices Updater for WooCommerce" Ok! as it includes a unique identifier and clarifies unaffiliation (Ask ChatGPT)



Have you checked for common technical issues?

Please ensure that your plugin adheres to best practices, including the following:

🔴 Use wp_enqueue commands

ℹ️ Why it matters: Because of performance and compatibility, please make use of the built in functions for including static and dynamic JS and/or CSS.

🔍 Identify JS and CSS outputs: Look for any <script> or <style> HTML tags in your plugin. In the majority of cases you could enqueue them.

🛠 Fix it: Make use of the specific function for enqueue them:
Type of code
Functions
Static JS
wp_register_script() , wp_enqueue_script() , admin_enqueue_scripts()
Inline JS
wp_add_inline_script()
Static CSS
wp_register_style() , wp_enqueue_style()
Inline CSS
wp_add_inline_style()

👉 In the public pages you can enqueue them using the hook wp_enqueue_scripts() .
👉 In the admin pages you can enqueue them using the hook admin_enqueue_scripts() . You can also use admin_print_scripts() and admin_print_styles() .
👉 As of WordPress 6.3, you can easily pass attributes like defer or async, as of WordPress 5.7, you can pass other attributes by using functions and filters.

Example:
function commaipo_enqueue_script() {
    wp_enqueue_script( 'commaipo_js', plugins_url( 'inc/main.js', __FILE__ ), array(), COMMAIPO_VERSION, true );
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'commaipo_enqueue_script' );
Your JS/CSS is now enqueued!

Possible cases from your plugin include:
src/Views/admin-settings.php:410 <script>
src/Admin/ProductEditor.php:131 <script type="text/javascript">


🔴 Trialware and Locked Features
Please review your plugin to ensure that it does not include any locked or restricted built-in functionality. This is not permitted under the WordPress.org Plugin Directory Guidelines you agreed to when submitting the plugin.

❌ Guideline 5 – Trialware
Plugins must be fully functional. You may not:
Lock, disable or limit built-in features behind a license key, trial period, usage limit, time, quota or any other kind of intended restriction.

Even if the locked feature is present in the code "just in case the user upgrades," it’s still not allowed. Your plugin may point out which features are available through a separated plugin, but that's it. All plugin code hosted on WordPress.org must be free and fully functional.

🌐 Guideline 6 – Serviceware
Plugins may connect to a legitimate external service to perform certain functionality, provided:
The service performs actual processing on external servers.
The functionality provided cannot be done locally by the plugin.
The service is clearly documented in your readme, including Terms of Use and Privacy Policy links.

For example: a "Spam checker" plugin that connects to a external service to check for spam (and thus uses it to provide that functionality) is generally acceptable. A plugin that simply checks a license key to unlock local features is not.

✅ Ask yourself:
Does any function only work after a license check or payment?
Is any functionality in the plugin code disabled or limited until it’s unlocked?
Are there any limitations on the plugin after a certain amount of time or usage?

After excluding functionalities provided by legitimate external services, if the answer is yes to any of the above, the plugin does not comply.

🔧 How to fix it:
Remove all license checks or other mechanisms that control access to features built in in the plugin code.
Remove or fully enable any built in features that are currently locked or limited.
Make sure external services are compliant and clearly documented.

ℹ️ Important clarification:
WordPress.org is not a marketplace. It's a repository for free, fully functional, GPL-compliant plugins.

If you are not offering a service and want to offer additional features through a paid version, that code must be:
Hosted elsewhere (e.g., your own website).
Not included in the plugin hosted on WordPress.org.
GPL compliant: Do not include any mechanisms that would prevent a plug-in from being used after a license has been checked.



Other details

We've detected some other details that you may want to check.

## The URL(s) declared in your plugin seems to be invalid or does not work.

From your plugin:

Plugin URI: https://wontonee.com/commeriq - commeriq.php - This URL replies us with a 404 HTTP code, meaning that it does not exists or it is not a public URL.

## Check your plugin files for sensitive information.

We know that some types of files are uncommon in plugins and could contain sensitive information.

By default, files such as database dumps, log files and backup files are accessible to any user.

They may have ended up there by mistake. Please check it just in case.

Example(s) from your plugin:
22_11-28-00_Archive/src/commeriq-loader.php.bak



## Requires Plugins: found possible dependencies.

The "Requires Plugins" header is a comma-separated list of WordPress.org-formatted slugs for its dependencies.

Does your plugin extend another plugin available in the WordPress.org directory? If so, you can use the "Requires Plugins" header to have WordPress check if that plugin is installed and activated before your plugin is activated.

You can check out the documentation at: https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/05/introducing-plugin-dependencies-in-wordpress-6-5/

We have found that your plugin probably extends another plugin, so using this header may be useful for you, please check it out.

Analysis result:
By checking your plugin slug "commeriq-ai-powered-commerce-insights-for-woocommerce" we found coincidences with "woocommerce"
You can easily solve this by adding or updating the "Requires Plugins" header at "commeriq.php", like so:
Requires Plugins: woocommerce



## Allowing direct file access to plugin files

Direct file access occurs when someone directly queries a PHP file. This can be done by entering the complete path to the file in the browser's URL bar or by sending a POST request directly to the file.

For files that only contain class or function definitions, the risk of something funky happening when accessed directly is minimal. However, for files that contain executable code (e.g., function calls, class instance creation, class method calls, or inclusion of other PHP files), the risk of security issues is hard to predict because it depends on the specific case, but it can exist and it can be high.

You can easily prevent this by adding the following code at the beginning of all PHP files that could potentially execute code if accessed directly:
    if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) exit; // Exit if accessed directly
Add it after the <?php opening tag and after the namespace declaration, if any, but before any other code.

Example(s) from your plugin:
tests/bootstrap.php:3
